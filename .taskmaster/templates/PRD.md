# Color Coordination App - PRD

<context>
# Overview  
Help men create stylish, color-coordinated formal wear combinations using established color theory principles. This app targets men who want to dress well but lack confidence in color coordination, with primary use cases including business attire, formal events, and date nights.

The app provides a progressive, visual approach to building outfit combinations rather than overwhelming users with abstract color theory. Users select an occasion, choose a suit color, pick a color scheme approach (monochromatic, analogous, or triadic), and receive curated combinations with confidence indicators.

# Core Features  
## 1. Occasion-Based Entry Point
**Why**: Filter appropriate color palettes before overwhelming with choices
- **Business Professional**: Conservative palettes, navy/charcoal/gray focus
- **Creative Professional**: Expanded color range, bolder combinations  
- **Formal Evening**: Black/navy emphasis, formal accessories
- **Social/Casual**: Broader spectrum, relaxed rules

## 2. Suit Color Selection
**Primary foundation piece** - user selects from curated palette based on occasion
- Visual color picker with fabric texture preview
- Popular colors prominently displayed
- Search/filter by color family

## 3. Color Scheme Selection
**After suit selection**, present 3 color theory approaches:

### Monochromatic
- Same color family, different shades/tints
- Safest option, always works
- Example: Navy suit → light blue shirt → navy tie → white pocket square

### Analogous  
- Adjacent colors on color wheel
- Harmonious, sophisticated
- Example: Navy suit → lavender shirt → purple tie → silver pocket square

### Triadic
- Colors equally spaced on color wheel
- Bold, creative approach
- Example: Navy suit → orange shirt → yellow tie → blue pocket square

## 4. Visual Combination Display
**Not abstract color wheels** - show actual clothing combinations:
- Illustrated suit/shirt/tie/pocket square combinations
- Fabric texture simulation
- Side-by-side comparison of options

## 5. Smart Recommendations
- **Default "safe" option** for each scheme
- **Alternative suggestions** for exploration
- **Warning indicators** for risky combinations
- **Confidence meter** for each combination

## 6. Customization & Overrides
- Fine-tune individual pieces
- Swap shirt/tie/pocket square independently
- Save favorite combinations
- Export combinations (screenshot, shopping list)

# User Experience  
**Target User**: Men who want to dress well but lack confidence in color coordination.

**User Personas**:
- Business Professional: Needs conservative, appropriate combinations for work
- Creative Professional: Wants more expressive options while staying professional
- Special Occasion: Formal events, date nights requiring elevated style

**Key User Flows**:
1. Landing page → Occasion selection
2. Occasion → Suit color picker
3. Suit selection → Color scheme choice
4. Scheme → Visual combinations display
5. Combination refinement → Save/export

**UI/UX Considerations**:
- Progressive disclosure: Don't overwhelm with choices upfront
- Visual over abstract: Show clothing, not color theory
- Confidence building: Clear "safe" vs "bold" indicators  
- Speed: Quick path to good combination
- Education: Subtle color theory learning without jargon

# Technical Architecture  
**Frontend Framework**: Nuxt 3 with Hybrid Rendering
- **SEO pages**: Static Site Generation (SSG) for marketing/educational content
- **App pages**: SPA mode for interactive tool functionality
- Built-in routing and auto-imports
- Great dev experience and deployment flexibility

**Styling & UI**:
- Tailwind CSS - modern, utility-first styling
- Headless UI Vue - accessible component primitives
- Heroicons - consistent icon system
- CSS transitions for smooth animations

**Visualizations**:
- **SVG-based suit illustrations** - scalable, lightweight, dynamically colorable
- **Fabric texture simulation** using SVG patterns, filters, and gradients
- Modular SVG components (jacket, shirt, tie, pocket square)

**State & Storage**:
- Pinia - app state management
- localStorage - persist user preferences and saved combinations
- Static JSON files - color data, schemes, business logic

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: MVP Foundation
**Goal**: Basic working app with core functionality

**SEO-friendly pages**: 
- Landing page with value proposition
- Color theory guide for education
- Examples showcase for inspiration

**Interactive tool core**:
- Occasion selection interface
- Basic suit color picker
- Simple combination display
- Static color database with 5-10 suit colors per occasion
- Basic color theory algorithms for 3-5 combinations per scheme

**Technical foundation**:
- Nuxt 3 project setup with hybrid rendering
- Basic SVG suit visualization
- Core state management with Pinia
- localStorage for basic persistence

## Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization
**Goal**: Rich visual experience and improved UX

**Advanced SVG system**:
- Detailed suit illustrations with modular components
- Fabric texture simulation using SVG patterns and filters
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Multiple viewing angles/styles

**Improved recommendations**:

# Logical Dependency Chain
**Foundation First** (Phase 1):
1. **Project Setup**: Nuxt 3 configuration, basic routing, core dependencies
2. **Data Layer**: Static JSON files for colors, schemes, basic algorithms
3. **Core Pages**: Landing page (SSG) for immediate web presence
4. **Basic App Flow**: Occasion → Suit → Combinations (minimal but functional)
5. **Simple Visualization**: Basic SVG suit display, enough to demonstrate concept

**Quick to Usable Frontend**:
- Landing page provides immediate value and SEO
- Basic app flow creates end-to-end user experience
- Simple visualization makes combinations tangible
- Static generation ensures fast loading and discoverability

**Build Upon Foundation** (Phase 2+):
- Enhanced SVG system builds on basic visualization
- Improved algorithms refine existing functionality
- Advanced features add polish without changing core architecture
- Each enhancement is atomic and can be developed/tested independently

**Atomic Feature Development**:
- Each color scheme type can be developed separately
- SVG components are modular and independently improvable
- Recommendation features can be added incrementally
- Storage and personalization layers can be enhanced without breaking core functionality

# Risks and Mitigations  
**Technical Challenges**:
- **Risk**: SVG complexity affecting performance
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple shapes, optimize incrementally. Use SVG sprites and caching.

- **Risk**: Color theory algorithm accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Research established color theory principles, test with fashion experts, iterate based on user feedback.

**MVP Scope Management**:
- **Risk**: Feature creep preventing launch
- **Mitigation**: Strict Phase 1 scope limit. 5-10 colors max, 3 schemes only, basic visualization.

- **Risk**: Over-engineering the visualization system
- **Mitigation**: Start with static SVG templates, add interactivity incrementally.

**User Adoption**:
- **Risk**: Users finding interface confusing
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure design, clear onboarding flow, user testing with target demographic.

- **Risk**: Lack of trust in recommendations
- **Mitigation**: Show confidence levels, provide "safe" defaults, explain reasoning subtly.

**Resource Constraints**:
- **Risk**: Complex frontend taking too long
- **Mitigation**: Use established component libraries (Headless UI), focus on functionality over visual polish initially.

- **Risk**: Color data curation overhead
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic color palette, curate from established menswear color guides.

# Appendix  
**Success Metrics**:
- **Primary**: User completes full combination (suit → scheme → final selection)
- **Engagement**: Time spent exploring combinations  
- **Satisfaction**: Combinations saved/exported
- **Retention**: Return visits for different occasions

**Out of Scope (V1)**:
- Women's fashion
