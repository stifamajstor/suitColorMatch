# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Color Scheme Selection Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create scheme selector for monochromatic, analogous, and triadic approaches
# Details:
Create components/SchemeSelector.vue with three color scheme options. Each scheme should display clear explanation, visual example, and difficulty/safety indicator. Implement scheme selection that triggers combination generation using color theory algorithms. Add educational tooltips explaining each approach without overwhelming users. Store selected scheme in Pinia state.

# Test Strategy:
Test scheme selection triggers correct algorithm, verify educational content displays properly, test state persistence and navigation flow
