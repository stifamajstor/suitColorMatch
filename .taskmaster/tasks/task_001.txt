# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Nuxt 3 project with hybrid rendering configuration, install core dependencies, and setup basic project structure
# Details:
Create new Nuxt 3 project using `npx nuxi@latest init colorApp`. Configure nuxt.config.ts for hybrid rendering with SSG for marketing pages and SPA for app pages. Install dependencies: Tailwind CSS, Headless UI Vue, Heroicons, Pinia. Setup basic folder structure: components/, composables/, data/, pages/ with app/ subdirectory. Configure Tailwind CSS integration and basic styling setup.

# Test Strategy:
