# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement modular SVG-based suit illustration system for displaying combinations
# Details:
Create components/SuitVisualizer.vue with modular SVG components for jacket, shirt, tie, and pocket square. Implement dynamic color application to SVG elements. Create basic suit template with proper layering and proportions. Use SVG patterns and filters for fabric texture simulation. Make components scalable and lightweight. Implement smooth color transitions when combinations change.

# Test Strategy:
Test SVG rendering across browsers, verify dynamic color changes work correctly, test scalability and performance with multiple combinations, validate texture pattern application
