# Description: Create visual color picker for suit selection with fabric texture preview
# Details:
Create components/ColorPicker.vue with visual color swatches filtered by selected occasion. Implement fabric texture preview using SVG patterns from textures.json. Add search/filter functionality by color family. Create components/TextureRenderer.vue for SVG texture pattern rendering. Store selected suit color in Pinia state. Implement responsive grid layout for color options.
