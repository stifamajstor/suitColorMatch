      "taskTitle": "Setup Nuxt 3 Project with Hybrid Rendering",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Nuxt 3 project setup into initialization, dependency installation, configuration for hybrid rendering, and folder structure setup tasks",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to hybrid rendering configuration which requires understanding of both SSG and SPA modes. The task involves multiple steps including project initialization, dependency management, and configuration setup."

      "taskTitle": "Create Static Data Layer and Color Theory Logic",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data layer implementation into separate tasks for each JSON file creation and the color theory algorithm implementation with unit tests",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the implementation of color theory algorithms requiring domain knowledge and mathematical calculations. Creating multiple structured data files and ensuring they work together adds cognitive complexity."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the landing page development into content creation, responsive design implementation, and SEO optimization subtasks",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on frontend implementation with SSG. The task is relatively straightforward but requires attention to SEO optimization and responsive design across devices."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Occasion Selection Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the occasion selection interface into UI component creation, state management implementation, and filtering logic subtasks",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity involving SPA page creation, state management with Pinia, and implementing filtering logic based on user selection. Requires coordination between UI and data layer."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the color picker implementation into component structure, texture rendering, search functionality, and state management integration",
      "reasoning": "Above average complexity due to the combination of visual components, texture rendering with SVG, search functionality, and state management integration. Requires careful UI design and performance considerations."

      "taskTitle": "Create Basic SVG Suit Visualization System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the SVG visualization system into individual component creation for each suit element, color application system, texture simulation, and animation implementation",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the technical challenges of creating a modular SVG system with dynamic color application, proper layering, and texture simulation. Requires deep SVG knowledge and careful component design."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Color Scheme Selection Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the scheme selector into UI component creation, educational content integration, and algorithm connection subtasks",
      "reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity requiring integration of UI components with color theory algorithms. The educational aspect adds complexity as it needs to be informative without overwhelming users."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the combinations view into visualization component integration, confidence scoring algorithm, recommendation engine, comparison view, and warning system implementation",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity as it integrates multiple previous components while adding sophisticated algorithms for confidence scoring and recommendations. Requires coordination between visualization, data processing, and user interface."
